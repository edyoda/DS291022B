# DSA - Data Structure and Algorithm (Algo)

# - Data structure is a collection of data, the relationship amoung them and the operation 
#   that can be applied on the data
# organizing the data
# managing the data

# Algorithm
# step by step procedure to solve the problem/program efficiently

# Building -> bricks,cement,rodes,woods -> Supervisor
# Software -> DSA                       -> code
