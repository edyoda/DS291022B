# syntax :
# class <class_name>:
#     body

# Class - It is the blueprint(planning)
# Object - It is the instance of the class
# Methods - functions which are created inside the class are known as methods!
#         - every function defined inside the class must have 'self' keyword as first parameter        
# self    - it's a keyword
#         - it represents current class object
